# 🛡️ TokenGuard — X1 EcoChain Grant Application

## Project: TokenGuard — Compliance-Ready ERC20 with On-Chain Policy Engine

### Overview
TokenGuard is a compliance-ready ERC20 token with built-in KYC, jurisdictional controls, daily transfer limits, account freezing, and a full on-chain audit trail. Designed for enterprises and RWA tokenization projects that need regulatory compliance without sacrificing decentralization.

### Why X1 EcoChain
- **Energy-efficient L1** — TokenGuard's compliance features align with X1's sustainable blockchain ethos
- **Enterprise focus** — X1 targets enterprise adoption; TokenGuard provides the compliance layer enterprises need
- **Low fees** — compliance checks on every transfer need affordable gas
- **Growing ecosystem** — early mover advantage for compliance infrastructure

### Features
1. **KYC Integration** — account-level identity verification
2. **Jurisdictional Controls** — allow/block transfers by jurisdiction
3. **Daily Transfer Limits** — configurable per-account daily limits with auto-reset
4. **Account Freezing** — freeze accounts with documented reasons
5. **Allowlist System** — institutional allowlists for whitelisted transfers
6. **On-Chain Audit Trail** — every transfer attempt logged (approvals AND rejections)
